# Freyr
This is intended to be as simple of a flask and HTML controle of a relay 
board (KEYESTUDIO 5V DCAC 4-Channel Relay Hat) on a raspberry pi as posible 
for  the purpose of replacing a sprinkler system controler.

Eventualy I intend to add a schedule via cron for the daily thing, but the 
main reason is so I can water the garden with the push of a virtual button.
